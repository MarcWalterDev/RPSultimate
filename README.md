# RPS Ultimate

![preview of page](/assets/images/readme/preview.png)

A game of rock, paper, scissors. Played troughout the ages (or at least since scissors and paper were invented) this timelesss classic is a game of chance and daring, now in digital form. Play three rounds head to head against the computer in the _ultimate_ battle of man vs machine. No friends required.

This application was designed as an interactive web app for an assignment from [The Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net)

## User Stories

### As a first time user I...

- want to play a game of rock, paper, scissors.
- want to learn the rules of the game.
- would like to see an attractive presentation.

### As a returning user I...

- want to play more rock, paper, scissors.

## Design

With this being a simple game I wanted to reflect that in the design with easy to use controls. It should be obvious what selection the user has made and also what selection the computer has made. The game should display who has won each round and declare the overall winner of the game. \
I would have liked to spend more time designing this game. I would like to use images of hands on either side of the play space representing the computer and player choices.

### Colours

I used the Coolors app to find the colour scheme. \

## Features

The page is split into two main sections the title area and the play space.

### Title area

This section simply contains the title of the game and a button for the instructions

### Play space

This section contains all the game features. It is where the instructions are displayed when the user clicks the button from the title section.
Upon first loading the page the user is presented with a button to start the game. \
Once the game been started the section will split into two sub-sections: \
The users and computers selection of the previous round and a message displaying whether the user won or lost. \
And buttons for the options of the current round; rock, paper or scissors.

### Future Features

- In a future release I would like to add the option to select the number of rounds for each game.
- Running score: show the scores during each for each round as the game progresses.

## Final thoughts

I've really stuggled with this section of the Code Institute course. I don't feel like I have a true understanding of the concepts. To say I am not happy with this project at the time of writing would be an understatement. Going forward I would like to better understand the concepts of JavaScript as it plays an important role in web development and is key to creating an emersive web experience for the user. I chose the RPS game due to it's simplicity in design but would have much rather created something with a little more complexity but I just ran out of time.
